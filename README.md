# first-portfolio

# Description
During this project I used HTML and code snippets from BootStrap to make my portfolio.
This is the first of many projects moving foward. I spent several hours figuring out how to add and modify
content to the bootstrap code to make it my own and add some additional style.

## Acknowledgment
Big thanks to Zach, Sergey, and Nick for getting together and working as a team. I think we all 
learned a little something from each other and look foward to working toether again in the near
future.

## Project Status
This is just the begining for this project. I plan on adding additional features
and links.
